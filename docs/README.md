## 📝 Contributing

When adding new documentation:
- User guides → `docs/guides/`
- Deployment docs → `docs/deployment/`
- Technical docs → `docs/technical/`
- Planning docs → `docs/planning/`
- Historical/completed → `archive/`

Keep the root directory clean - only README.md and TODO.md should live there!
